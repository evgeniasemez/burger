# burger

# From user perspective:
This app is about submitting a favorite burger by typing a name in the text box and clicking Submit button and "eating" it by clicking devour button

# from tech perspective: what was used
espress, handlebars, path, mysql, heroku, ajax, api(GET, POST, PUT, DELET), orm, controllers, module exports

# The hardest part:
The hardest part of this project i run into was setting connection between heroku and mysql
once it was done i finished the rest of coding pretty confidentally.
